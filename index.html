      <h2 class="home-headline-1">A safe and loving environment</h2>
      <p class="home-paragraph-1">Our home is in a very safe neighborhood in the West End. We live in a cul-de-sace, so we do not have a lot of through traffic, so the kids can play in the front yard safely. Our home is child proof, with child gates to keep the kids in the family room area, as well as safety latches to keep counters closed. We take care of the kids with love. It is very common for the kids to not want to leave with their parents at the end of the day, because they want to stay since they are having so much fun. Our daycare is only about 8 kids. Therefore, they are less likely to catch an illness than if they were at a large daycare.</p>

      <h2 class="home-headline-2">Learning environment</h2>
      <p class="home-paragraph-2">We provide potty training for any toddlers who need it. We also provide Kindergarten preparation by teaching the alphabet as well as getting the kids familiar with Spanish. We also have fun activities during the day like coloring and playing with playdoh. We also have field trips every so often to places like the zoo, where the kids can get out of the house and experience new activities.</p>
